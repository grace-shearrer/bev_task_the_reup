# taste task re-up

This is an updated taste task. The training task has all matched pairs. The PE task is a prediction error task with only the milkshake cue. Please note that you need a folder outside of the task folder called, Train_Output. The task assumes that it and the Train_Output folder are in your computer's documents folder. You can change these but you will need to change the code in the python tasks and in the onset efficiency files (if you need new onsets)  If you have questions please contact Grace Shearrer at grace.shearrer@gmail.com
